<h2>
summarize the number of transitions and associated data,
over all parallelograms in the boundary of a zonohedron
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 2-transition surface is a union of parallelograms.
For this function, the surface is required to be strictly starshaped at
the center.
For the definition of <em>strictly starshaped</em> see
<a href="../doc/transitions.html">The 2-Transition Subcomplex and the 2-Transition Surface</a>.
</p>
<p>Each parallelogram has a unit normal that defines a linear functional.
<br>
If the 2-transition parallelogram is in the <em>interior</em> of the zonohedron
then the functional is not maximized on the parallelogram,
and there is a corresponding similar parallelogram
on the boundary of the zonohedron where the functional *is* maximized.
The first parallelogram (in the surface) is called <em>deficient</em> because
the functional is not maximized,
and the second parallelogram (in the boundary)
is called <em>abundant</em> because the number of corresponding
transitions across this parallelogram is more than 2.
The difference between the functional values is called the <em>deficit</em>.
<br>
If the 2-transition parallelogram is on the boundary,
then it is called <em>coincident</em>.
It is also called <em>non-deficient</em> and the deficit is 0.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">transitionsdf( x, trans2=TRUE )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>a <b>zonohedron</b> object as returned by the constructor <code>zonohedron()</code>.
The 2-transition surface must be strictly starshaped.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trans2</code></td>
<td>

<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, then include metrics on the non-deficient (coincident)
parallelograms, with 2 transitions.
This is always the first row of the returned data frame.
<br> 
if <code>FALSE</code>, then data on the non-deficient parallelograms
is not included, and the returned data frame only has data
on the deficient parallelograms, with more than 2 transitions.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>transitionsdf()</code> returns a <code>data.frame</code> with a row
for each number of transitions found,
plus a final row with totals on appropriate columns.
The columns are:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transitions</code></td>
<td>

<p>the number of transitions, a positive even integer, in increasing order.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallelograms</code></td>
<td>

<p>the number of parallelograms with the given number of transitions
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area</code></td>
<td>

<p>the min and max of the area of the
parallelograms with the given number of transitions
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area.sum</code></td>
<td>

<p>the total area of the parallelograms with the given number of transitions
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deficit</code></td>
<td>

<p>the min and max of the deficit of the
parallelograms with the given number of transitions.
When there are 2 transitions the deficit should be exactly 0,
but is usually slightly non-0 due to truncation.
When there are more than 2 transitions the deficit is positive.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>example</code></td>
<td>

<p>the 2 generators (from the ground set of the simplified matroid)
of the parallelogram with the maximum area
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In case of error, the function returns <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Because of the 1-1 correspondence between similar parallelograms,
the surface areas of the 2-transition surface
and the boundary of the zonohedron are equal.
