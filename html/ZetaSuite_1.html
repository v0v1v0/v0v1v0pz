<h2>
Subsampled data from in-house HTS2 screening for global splicing regulators.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1609 individual screened genes and 100 functional readouts. The data was generated from a siRNA screen for global splicing regulators. In this screen, we interrogated ~400 endogenous alternative splicing (AS) events by using an oligo ligation-based strategy to quantify 18,480 pools of siRNAs against annotated protein-coding genes in the human genome.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("countMat")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1609 observations on the following 100 variables
</p>

<p>A data frame with 1609 observations on the following 100 maker variables.Each row represents gene with specific knocking-down siRNA pool, each column is an AS event. The values in the matrix are the processed foldchange values between included exons and skipping exons read counts.
