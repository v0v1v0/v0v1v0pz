<h2>Zseq : Integer Sequence Generator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The world of integer sequence has long history, which has been accumulated in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
Even though <code>R</code> is not a first pick for many number theorists, we introduce our package to enrich the <code>R</code> ecosystem as well as
provide pedagogical toolset. We adopted <span class="pkg">gmp</span> for flexible large number computations in that users can easily experience
large number sequences on a non-exclusive generic computing platform.
