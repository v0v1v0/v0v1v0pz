<h2>zfit: Fit Models in a Pipe</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Improve the usage of model fitting functions within a piped
work flow.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>zfit</code> makes it easier to use a piped workflow with functions that don’t
have the “correct” order of parameters (the first parameter of the
function does not match the object passing through the pipe).
</p>
<p>The issue is especially prevalent with model fitting functions, such as
when passing and processing a <code>data.frame</code> (or <code>tibble</code>) before passing
them to <code>lm()</code> or similar functions. The pipe passes the data object
into the first parameter of the function, but the conventional
estimation functions expect a formula to be the first parameter.
</p>
<p>This package addresses the issue with three functions that make it
trivial to construct a pipe-friendly version of any function:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>zfunction()</code> reorders the arguments of a function. Just pass the name
of a function, and the name of the parameter that should receive the
piped argument, and it returns a version of the function with that
parameter coming first.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>zfold()</code> creates a fold (a wrapper) around a function with the
reordered arguments. This is sometimes needed instead of a simple
reordering, for example for achieving correct S3 dispatch, and for
functions that report its name or other information in output.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>zfitter()</code> takes any estimation function with the standard format of
a <code>formula</code> and <code>data</code> parameter, and returns a version suitable for
us in pipes (with the <code>data</code> parameter coming first). Internally, it
simply calls the <code>zfold()</code> function to create a fold around the fitter
function.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The package also includes ready made wrappers around the most commonly
used estimation functions. <code>zlm()</code>and <code>zglm()</code> correspond to <code>lm()</code> and
<code>glm()</code>, and <code>zlogit()</code>, <code>zprobit()</code>, and <code>zpoisson()</code>, use <code>glm()</code> to
perform logistic or poisson regression within a pipe.
</p>
<p>Finally, the package includes the <code>zprint()</code> function, which is intended
to simplify the printing of derived results, such as <code>summary()</code>, within
the pipe, without affecting the modeling result itself.
