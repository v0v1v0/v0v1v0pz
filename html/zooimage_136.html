<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ZooImage Metadata/Measurements ('.zim' and '_dat1.zim' files, respectively)
are text files containing metadata (that is, additional information required
to process the images, like sample identification, information about
collection and process of the sample, digitizing hardware and software, etc.).
These metadata are represented as a pair 'key' = 'value' in ANSI encoding and
are organized into sections written in square brackets on a separate line. For
instance, '[Subsample]' defines a 'Subsample' section. The first line of .zim
files must always be 'ZI1' in the case of ZooImage version 1, 'ZI2' for
version 2, and 'ZI3' for current version. This identifiant allows for making
incompatible changes in future versions without taking the risk to
accidentally try processing these newer versions with an old, incompatible
version of ZooImage in the future. Here are the first few lines of an example
.zim file: for instance).
</p>
<pre>
ZI3
[Image]
Hardware=EPSON 4870
Software=VueScan 8.0.10  # See ZooImage.ini file for VueScan config
...
    </pre>
<p>After 'ZI3' in the first line, there is a definition of an 'Image' section,
with two keys: 'Hardware' with value 'EPSON 4870' and 'Software' with value
'VueScan 8.0.10', followed by a comment (everything after the '#' sign). Take
care: since '#' defines a comment, do not use it, neither in keys, nor in
values!
</p>
<p>Take care to define <b>unique keys accross all sections</b>! The section are
just there to organize your metadata into logical subunits... but they are not
considered in the process. If you define a key named 'mykey' both in
'[Section1]' and in '[Section2]', only the first occurence of 'mykey' will be
used by ZooImage!
</p>
<p>The ZooImage Measurements ('_dat1.zim' files) are structured the same way,
but there is a special '[Data]' section at the end that contains a
tab-delimited table with all measurements done on identified objects, during
the image analysis (process of the images). This table starts with a header
naming the colums, with two first columns being necessary '!Item' and 'Label'.
'Label' is the name of the image where the object is found and 'Item' is a
unique identifier (usually a number) given to that object in the image (i.e.,
Label+Item is the unique identifier of each object in the whole series). The
other columns define the measurements done on the objects (area, perimeter,
length, distribution of gray levels, etc.). The amount and name of
measurements are not fixed. It is the particular ImageJ plugin that you use to
process your image that defines them (it means that adding new measurements is
very easy to do and they are automatically considered by ZooImage).
</p>
<p>Note that these measurements are converted using calibration information, if
available. That is, lengths are in microns, surfaces are in squre microns and
gray levels are in OD (Optical Densities), so that, measurements are
comparable from picture to picture, even if spatial resolution or distribution
of gray levels (contrast, luminosity, ...) are not exactly the same in all
images of the series! The table must also contains four additional columns
with obligatory names being 'BX', 'BY', 'Width', 'Height'. There are the
coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box around the object (BX,
BY) and the Width and Height of this box. These fields are required to locate
the object in the original image. Here is a short abstract of a [Data] section:
</p>
<pre>
... (metadata definitions as above)

[Data]
!Item  Label    Area    Perim.  ...(other mes.)  BX     BY    Width  Height
1      Smp1+A1  0.4634  0.0582  ...              28.89  0.20  1.42   0.83
2      Smp1+A1  0.0705  0.0244  ...              72.40  0.35  2.33   32.16
3      Smp1+A2  0.0498  0.0566  ...              75.43  0.69  75.44  0.70
...
    </pre>
<p>The reasons to choose such a simple text format for representing metadata is
simplicity and flexibility. Plain text files are readable by any computer
program and no sophisticated database engine, or database structure, is
required to represent those data. Also, besides obligatory fields in the
metadata sections, you can add as many key=value entries as you need to
collect together the metadata required in your particular application.
ZooImage will automatically read them and store them at the right place,
available to you at any time during your analyses in ZooImage! That way,
ZooImage is very flexible and capable to process many different kinds of data,
even most exotic ones.
</p>
<p><code>zimCreate()</code> and <code>zimEdit()</code> call the associated metadata editor
(by default, the one defined as <code>options(fileEditor = ....)</code>. By default,
it is the same program as used by <code>fileEdit()</code> in the svMisc package. You
can also use a spreadsheet, like Excel, Gnumeric, or OpenOffice Calc to edit
these files. This is particularly useful for the tabular '[Data]' section,
more comfortably edited in as a spreadsheed. Just save your file as
dQuotetab-delimited text file when you have done and close the spreadsheet
program (Excel won't allow ZooImage to access the .zim file when the file is
opened as a spreadsheet). Just redefine <code>options(fileEditor = ...)</code> to
use, e.g, Excel automatically with ZooImage (full path of the 'Excel.exe'
file).
</p>
<p><code>zimMake()</code> creates one or more .zim files corresponding to the selected
list of images provided in 'images', and allows for editing them one-by-one.
It is the basic function for creating all .zim files manually for a set of
images to be analyzed in ZooImage. See also <code>zieMake()</code> for an
alternative, and automatic way to create all those .zim files.
</p>
<p><code>zimExtractAll()</code> and <code>zimUpdateAll()</code> work in conjonction with
zipped TIFF image, as obtained by <code>zipImg()</code> and <code>zipImgAll()</code>
(also done using <code>zidCompress</code>). In these .zip files, metadata is located
in the zip archive comment. This comment is extracted into corresponding .zim
file by <code>zimExtractAll()</code> for one or several zip archives. On the other
hand, these comments are updated in the zip archive with latest information
present in .zim files using <code>zimUpdateAll()</code>.
</p>
<p>The last functions are auxiliary utilities to deal with .zim files (see also
<code>zimList()</code>). <code>isZim()</code> simply checks if the file is a correct .zim
file, checking first line of the file that must be 'ZI1-3' for ZooImage
version 1-3. This routine returns <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> according to the
result (the file extension is also checked if <code>check.ext = TRUE</code>).
</p>
<p>Finally, <code>zimVerify()</code> is a very important function. It checks the
validity and syntax of any .zim file. All required fields are checked. In case
of an error, the function returns an explicit error message as a character
string. On the other hand, if the verification process succeeds, the function
returns a number corresponding to the number of objects whose measurements are
recorded in the data table (for a '_dat1.zim' file), or '0' (zero, no
measurements) for a '.zim' file containing only metadata.
</p>
<p><code>zimVerify()</code> checks for the presence of required fields. For .zim files:
Section '[Image]' with 'Author', 'Hardware', 'Software' and 'ImageType' (for
instance, "trans_16bits_gray" for a 16bit graylevels picture obtained by
transparency, that is, using transmitted light) fields, section '[Fraction]'
with 'Code' (A, B, C, ...), 'Min' and 'Max' (the minimum and maximum mesh
sizes used to fraction the sample, or -1 if Min and or Max sieves are not
used) and section '[Subsample]' with fields 'Subpart' (a number indicating how
much of the fraction is actually digitized, for instance, 0.15 for 15% of the
fraction), 'SubMethod' (volumetry, Motoda, etc.), 'CellPart' (the fraction of
the digitizing cell actually covered by all images made), 'Replicates',
'VolIni' (the volume of seawater, in cubic meters or any of your favored unit,
that was collected in the sea for this sample) and 'VolPrec', the precision at
which 'VolIni' is measured, expressed in the same unit.
</p>
<p>For '_dat1.zim' files, the function checks for the presence of all the
previous fields, plus: '[Process]' section with fields 'Version' (version of
the processing function), 'Method' (method used to process the images),
'MinSize', 'MaxSize' (the minimum and maximum ecd -equivalent circular
diameter- of the particule to be considered and measured), 'Calibration' (data
for gray levels calibration) and 'ProcessPixSize' (data for spatial
calibration: size of one pixel in microns, or any of your favorite length
unit). Column headers 'Item', 'Label', 'BX', 'BY', 'Height', 'Width', plus at
least one additional measrurement are checked too.
If <code>check.table = TRUE</code>, the function also tries to read the table of
measurements and checks for its integrity (it takes longer for checking many
large '_dat1.zim' files!).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>zimCreate()</code>, <code>zimEdit()</code>, <code>zimMake()</code> are invoked for their
side-effect of creating and/or editing .zim files on disk. <code>zimCreate()</code>
returns <code>TRUE</code> invisibly, in case of successfull creation of all required
.zim files, <code>FALSE</code> otherwise (details of problems are returned using
warnings. The same mechanism (returning <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> invisibly,
with detailled description of the problem in warnings) is used by
<code>zimExtractAll()</code> and <code>zimUpdateAll()</code> also called for their
side-effects of manipulating .zim/.zip files.
</p>
<p><code>isZim()</code> simply returns <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p><code>zimVerify()</code> returns an integer in case of successful verification of
the .zim file. This integer represents the number of objects in the
measurement table (zero, if there is no '[Data]' section in the file, see
hereunder). In the case of an error during verification, the function returns
a character string with explicit description of the problem.
</p>
<p><code>zimDatMakeFlowCAM()</code> and <code>zimDatMakeAllFlowCAM()</code> are, as you
expect, special functions to transform FlowCAM metadata into dat1.zim formats.
They return <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> invisibly, and issue warnings in case
of problems.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Developers have the opportunity to add custom fields (both sections and keys
in these sections) to be checked by <code>zimVerify()</code>, in order to match
specific uses of ZooImage. Since the verification of metadata is a critical
step in the analysis, they are strongly encouraged to add such custom rules:
the default checking procedure is very basic!
</p>
<p>There are two possible ways to extend verification: adding fields in the list
of required ones, or using a custom function. The second solution is more
complex, but you have the possibility to check also the values associated with
keys, where the first solution just check the presence of those keys, no
mathers the values associated with them. You can combine both approaches.
</p>
<p>To add required keys to be checked, just create an option(ZI.zim = list(....))
with a list of four components: "zim.required", "dat1.zim.required",
"dat1.data.required" and "active". Put the list of sections (between square
brackets) and keys that must be present in the '.zim' files in "zim.required"
and those that must be present in the '_dat1.zim' files in "dat1.zim.required"
components. Place a list of column headers that you need in the [Data] table in
the "dat1.data.required" component of the list. The "active" component must be
<code>TRUE</code> to activate the verification of these extra fields and column
headers (otherwise, they are ignored). See the example hereunder.
</p>
<p>To add your own verification rules, add a R function in the "verify" component
of the list. That function should be defined as:
<code>function(zimfile, ...) # Your code here</code> and it should return either ""
(if no error found), or an explicit message in case of error(s).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can completelly redefine <code>zimVerify()</code> in the
"verify.all" component of the list. In this case, the other rules are
completelly ignored, and you must perform the whole treatment in your function
(start from the code of <code>zimVerify()</code> to make sure your own function has
a similar behaviour!
</p>
<p>Look at examples, and you will better understand how this works!
