<h2>
The cell x gene matrix from single-cell RNA-seq. 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A scRNA-seq dataset generated from placenta that has been analyzed with CellRanger and used to develop EmptyDrops. We have subsampled the genes from the real datasets to generated the matrix. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("countMatSC")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1090 cells and 10000 genes. This is the subset of data obtained from single-cell RNAseq for package testing.  Each row represents one cell detected in single-cell RNA-seq, each column is one gene in detected cells. The values in the matrix are the raw read counts from single-cell RNAseq.
