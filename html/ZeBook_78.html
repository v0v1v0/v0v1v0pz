<h2>Weather series for western France from NASA POWER agroclimatology</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This contemporary daily climate dataset for West of France
covers the period 1st January 1984 to 31 December 2011.
The precipitation data is limited to the period Jan-1997 Aug-2009, thus only 12 complete
years of data were available for  analysis involving precipitation(1997 to 2009).
It cover main part of West part of France defined as a rectangle.
The dataset was extracted from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project which provide
agroclimatology dataset (Chandler et al., 2004). 
It was funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program
This climate dataset contains daily estimates of precipitation, mean, minimum and
maximum temperature, relative humidity, dew point, solar radiation
and wind speed with global coverage at one degree resolution
(approximately 111 km at the equator).
The NASA POWER agroclimatology data are derived from various
sources: solar radiation from satellite observations, meteorological
data from the Goddard Earth Observing System global assimilation
model version 4 (GEOS-4), and precipitation from the Global
Precipitation Climate Project and Topical Rainfall Measurement
Mission. A full description can be found at
