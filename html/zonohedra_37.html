<h2>
test points against a 2-transition surface
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function tests points for being inside the 2-transition surface
associated with a zonohedron.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">inside2trans( x, p )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>a <b>zonohedron</b> object
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>

<p>an Nx3 numeric matrix. The points to be tested are in the rows.
<code>p</code> can also be a numeric vector that can be converted
to such a matrix, by row.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the surface has no self-intersections,
the the definition of whether a point <code>p</code> is
"inside" is fairly straightforward:
it is where the linking number of
<code>p</code> and the surface is non-zero.
In fact, if it is non-zero then it must be +1 or -1.
The <em>linking number</em> is analogous the <em>winding number</em>
in 2D, for more discussion see <b>Note</b>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is currently no test for whether the
surface <em>has</em> self-intersections,
For a bad surface with self-intersections,
the linking number might be any integer.
Since there is no such test,
we simply use the same non-zero linking number rule always.
</p>
<p>The computed <code>linkingnumber</code> is returned so that the user
can apply the non-zero rule, or the even-odd rule,
as appropriate for their situation.
These 2 rules are analogous to the two winding number rules
used for polygons in computer graphics,
see <b>Point in polygon</b>.
</p>
<p>The case where a point is <em>on</em> the surface
(i.e. the <code>distance</code> to the surface is 0) is problematic.
The <code>linkingnumber</code> is then undefined,
and we currently set <code>inside</code> to be undefined as well.
Thus <code>inside</code> should be interpreted as <em>strictly inside</em>.
However, in some situations, the user may want to consider
<code>inside</code> to be <code>TRUE</code> in this problematic case.
Or the user may want to consider points that are within
a very small epsilon of the surface,
where roundoff might have occurred, to have <code>inside=FALSE</code>
or <code>inside=NA</code>.
So the both the computed <code>linkingnumber</code> and <code>distance</code> are
returned so the user can use them
to make their own definition of what "inside" means.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>inside2trans()</code> returns a <code>data.frame</code>
with N rows and these columns:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given point</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the distance from the point to the surface.
This is the true Euclidean distance,
and not a "pseudo-distance" as in the case of <code>inside()</code>.
If the point is on the surface, the <code>distance</code> should be 0
up to numerical precision.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>linkingnumber</code></td>
<td>
<p>the linking number of the point and the surface.
If the point is <em>on</em> the surface (<code>distance==0</code>),
the (mathematical) linking number is undefined,
and the computed <code>linkingnumber</code> is <code>NA</code> (integer).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inside</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether the point is inside the surface; a logical.
This is currently set to <code>linkingnumber != 0</code>.
If the <code>linkingnumber</code> is <code>NA</code> (integer),
then <code>inside</code> is <code>NA</code> (logical).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timecalc</code></td>
<td>
<p>the time to do the calculations, in seconds</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If the row names of <code>p</code> are unique,
they are copied to the row names of the output.
<br>
In case of error, the function returns <code>NULL</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The standard definition of the
<em>linking number</em> of a point and a surface uses intersections with rays,
see the vignette
<a href="../doc/transitions.html">The 2-Transition Subcomplex and the 2-Transition Surface</a>
for the precise definition.
This is fine in theory, but in practice does not handle well
the case when the ray intersects the boundary of a parallelogram.
So this function uses an integral formula for the degree of a <em>linking map</em>
that reduces to summing the signed area of a lot of spherical triangles, see
<b>Spivak</b> p. 75 and
<b>Guillemin and Pollack</b> p. 188.
